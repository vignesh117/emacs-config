This is my personal emacs config. I've tried to make use of (limited)
*Spacemacs*-like keybindings where ever possible. So, the config makes
use of =evil= mode heavily. Some of the common keybindings are 

1. ~SPC f f~ - Open file
2. ~SPC b b~ - Show active buffers
3. ~SPC b d~ - Delete buffer

*Python mode*
1. ~, p~ - Open python REPL (shell)
2. ~, z~ - Switch to python REPL
3. ~, s b~ - Send entire buffer to shell for evaluation 
4. ~M-ENT~ - Send current line to shell for evaluation
5. ~C-ENT~ - Send function to shell for evaluation


*Org mode*
1. ~, e~ - Org export dispatch

I've tried (by best) to make emacs load faster and be un-obtrusive as
much as possible. To that end, I've tried to /not/ load features that
might increase typing lag. 
   
The config is highly evolving, so new packages may be added to it on a
regular basis. Feel free to clone and use the entire repo / pick up
snippets along the way.
