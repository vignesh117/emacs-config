This document shares some notes about the configuration in
~init.org~. Despite being a literate configuration, I feel that the
configuration is not nicely laid out. This is more like a cheat sheet
for my own reference in most cases. 

* Instructions
The configuration needs the following to get the full effect
1. Overpass font from [[https://overpassfont.org/][here]]
2. Install all the necessary font sets by invoking ~M-x
   all-the-icons-install-fonts~. This will install font packages such
   as font-awesome (required by the modeline) and other useful fonts.
3. Install the following packages using your OS package manager
   - rg (search utility)
   - <TO BE UPDATED>
4. 

* Programming mode keybindings

** General programming
